Image-Garage-App
================
//Folder descriptions at the bottom of the page.

A iOS Layering, filtering and drawing app based on two open source sets of code.

Credits/Thanks to these developers for there work that made this possible:

Nathanial Woolls Simple Drawing Open Source application, more info here

Brad Larson's well known GPU Image Filters also open source available here https://github.com/BradLarson/GPUImage

Without their contributions to the community this project would have taken me a very long time. I had a massive list of open source projects and I Narrowed it down to these 2 before starting and eventually ended up with exactly the helpful application I set out to get/git.

I used Simple Drawing as the base of the application and basically used GPU Image Filter as a extension. I put a lot of work into smoothing both out and protecting the application from crashing and I wish would have used github during that work to track the changes made. During the first version I had to drop a lot of options for layers, and unlimited undos until the 2nd version. I hope someone finds this use full and takes it even further I received a lot of great feedback from those who use it daily and that it self was well worth the work. 

If anyone out there would like to make a iPad application I think this would be a good start. Any work done directly with this I would love to hear about it or even post it here in the readme just email iPhoneHungry@yahoo.com

I made most of my code changes to this source to handle heavy user use and image manipulation without any crashes.

Source and Submodules folders: Contain Brad Larson Source for GPU Image filtering code for processing image filters. Not all manipulation options were made available in this app. Original source at https://github.com/BradLarson/GPUImage
